        <p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is neurodegenerative
            incurable disease, approximately 50% of patients with ALS
            die within 30 months of symptom onset. There is no
            biological marker for ALS and the diagnosis is made based
            on constellation of clinical observations. On average, it takes
            over a year to arrive at the diagnosis. Using an acoustic
            analysis of voice and speech is a promising way to improve the
            process of ALS detection and monitoring of disease progression. It becomes possible since bulbar motor
            changes (i.e., difficulty with speech or swallowing) are the first symptoms
            in approximately 30% of persons with ALS. Almost all
            people with ALS display bulbar symptoms at later stages. It
            is important that abnormal acoustic parameters of voice were
            also demonstrated in ALS subjects with perceptually normal
            vocal quality on sustained phonation.

        <p>The need for development voice and speech diagnostic tools
            has motivated recent work on elaboration of special acoustic
            analysis methods. One important aspect of current research
            related to neurological disease detection (such as Parkinson's
            and ALS) is that they targeted to use smartphones and tablets
            to record the voice using standard microphone in the different
            home environments. Advancement in this direction can
            lead to creation of easy to use self- and tele-monitoring and
            disease detection means.

        <p>So, What you need to do to check if you are suffering from ALS what you need to do is record your voice while speaking the vowel "A" 
            in a consistent pitch for about 5 seconds and upload that file in ".WAV" format and the name of the file should be your mobile number.
            For example if your mobile number is 1234512345 then the name of your audio file should be "1234512345.wav".
